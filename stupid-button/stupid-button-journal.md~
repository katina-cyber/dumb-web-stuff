# Stupid Button Journal

## 2.12.2020
In one of my elective classes (about introductory web development), my instructor wants us to create a simple page where the button is unclickable. I have just the right idea for this... 

Plan:  
- Have the button be an image
- Upon mousing over the button, have it change position and make a noise
- If the user successfully clicks on the button, take them to another page with music playing

Having a problem with my .wav file not playing when I press the button...  

Going to try converting the .wav file to a .mp3 file to see if that helps
