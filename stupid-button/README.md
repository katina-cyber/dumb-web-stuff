# Stupid Button Journal

## 2.12.2020
In one of my elective classes (about introductory web development), my instructor wants us to create a simple page where the button is unclickable. I have just the right idea for this... 

Plan:  
- Have the button be an image
- Upon mousing over the button, have it change position and make a noise
- If the user successfully clicks on the button, take them to another page with music playing

Having a problem with my .wav file not playing when I press the button...  

Going to try converting the .wav file to a .mp3 file to see if that helps 

Found out that if you simply play a sound while mousing over an element, the sound won't play unless the user has interacted with the site, like through clicking the button! I have an idea for this... But first I need to get the functionality down. 

I've successfully made the button move upon a mouse hover. Now, I need to add some style.  

I decided on a flashy font and a pastel background. Trying to give it my own personal style here. 

I liked how the button jumped around, but I didn't like how it would go super far down the page and make the user scroll. 

After a certain point, I felt like I had finished the assignment. Now I'm just adding more style and other fun tidbits, for fun!  

For some reason my "yee him back" button is making the yee-button move. I'm not sure why this is. It executes the wrong function on onclick.

I still can't get the "yee him back" button to work properly. This is a homework assignment and I have already met the requirements for the assignments. Since I have other assignments I need to do, I have to just put this one on hold, submit it, and revisit it in the future.
